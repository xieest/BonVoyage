**Bon Voyage**

Created by: Ester Xie


**Description:**

Bon Voyage was created to highlight different locations around the world. 
Traveling for me is a stress reliver, and with covid
hopefully winding down in the upcoming months, I hope that more
people will be able to use my website to decide on their next travel destination.
I was inspired by the lifestyle blog elements, which attract readers with their
creativity and keeps them coming back for more updates, and a vacation site that 
allows readers to book flights to their next destination.
Traveling takes us out of our comfort zone, and allows us to see, taste, and
try new things, and I cannot wait to hear more about the meaningful experiences
others have as they embrace new adventures.

**Technical Specifications:**

**Homepage:**
- Landing page for my site. Used to describe why I created Bon Voyage.

**Places to Visit:**
- Describes each of the 6 different continents I'll be covering.
- In the future, implement a landing page for each of these locations
with popular activities and places to visit.

**Flights:**
- Grabbed a public web API called Aviation Stack. Able to grab 100 free flights 
per day. I grabbed the ones flying out the next day, so that the flights
are always updated.

**Register:**
- A dropdown menu that offers two options:
-- Users can either register for an account.
-- When registered, users will be able to see flights, and
book the flights, or use the contact us form for any questions
and concerns they might have.
