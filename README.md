#Bon Voyage

Created by: Ester Xie


Description:

Bon Voyage was created to highlight different locations around the world. 
Traveling for me is a stress reliver, and with covid
hopefully winding down in the upcoming months/years, I hope that more
people will be able to use my website to decide on their next travel destination.
Traveling takes us out of our comfort zone, and allows us to see, taste, and
try new things, and I cannot wait to hear more about the meaningful experiences
others have as they embrace new adventures.

Technical Specifications:

Homepage:
- Landing page for my site. Used to describe why I created Bon Voyage.

Places to Visit:
- Describes each of the 6 different continents I'll be covering.
- In the future, implement a landing page for each of these locations
with popular activities and places to visit.

Flights:
- WIP. Need to implement an API to grab flight prices, and create
a page where travelers can book their plane tickets.

Register:
- A dropdown menu that offers two options:
-- Users can either register for an account, which will allow them
to save their destinations, or use the contact us form for any questions
and concerns they might have.
